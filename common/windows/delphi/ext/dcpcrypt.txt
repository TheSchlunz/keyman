Build notes
-----------

********************************************************************************
WARNING: THIS PACKAGE IS DEPRECATED. DO NOT DEPEND ON THIS PACKAGE FOR NEW CODE.
********************************************************************************

This package is used only for the RC4 cipher, and only for the legacy component
GlobalProxySettings. We should be able to eliminate this component in future and
depend on the Windows proxy settings, and at that point, we can remove the
remaining pieces of dcpcrypt.

All unused files have been removed from the folder; only the RC4 cipher and its
dependencies remain.
