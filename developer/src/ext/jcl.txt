Build notes
-----------

No package required; relevant files are included by each project. Extraneous files removed to make repository smaller; only source included.
Could remove additional source files, e.g. zlib, etc.

NOTE: we have removed the majority of files from this library, as they are unused,
and as we continue to deprecate use of Delphi.
